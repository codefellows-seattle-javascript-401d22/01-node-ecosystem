##
In your README.md file, describe the exported values of each module defined in your lib directory. Every function description should include it's airty (expected number of parameters), the expected data for each parameter (data-type and limitations), and the expected output behavior (for both valid and invalid use). Feel free to include any additional information that you would like.

In my greet.js module, the exported value will be one string that reads 'hello (argument passed into the function).  For example, if 'world' is passed in, the export will be 'hello world'. 

In my arithmetic.js module, there will be two exported values.  One will be from the exports.add function, which will require two integer arguments.  The expected return will be a sum of these two numbers.
The other exported value will be the exports.sub function.  This will also require two integers as arguments and will return the difference of these two integers.
