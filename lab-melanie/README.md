### Module Documentation

#### Greet Module
The `greet.js` module in the `lib` directory exports a single function. It has a single arity (parameter) with a string as its expected type. Should it receive the appropriate input, the output will be concatenated with "Hello". Should another data type be used, a null error will be thrown. 

#### Arithmetic Module
The `arithmetic.js` module in the `lib` directory exports an object with two methods. Both methods have an arity of two, both of which are expected to be integers. Should the `add` method receive the appropriate inputs, the output will be the sum of both inputs. Similarly, the `sub` method will subtract the second parameter from the first. Should another data type be used in either method, a null error will be thrown.
